If you are using the Ubuntu image then this is how you SSH or bash into it a Docker container:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">docker <span class=\"token function\">exec</span> -it ubuntu_container <span class=\"token function\">bash</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Note the <code class=\"language-text\">--it</code> option which allows you to keep STDIN open even if not attached and allocate a pseudo-TTY. You can also run a command under given user by using the <code class=\"language-text\">-u</code> option. See the official <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/#usage\">exec Docker documentation</a> for more info.</p>\n<p>If the above does not work for you or if you are using a different Linux distribution the try the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"bash\"><pre class=\"language-bash\"><code class=\"language-bash\">docker <span class=\"token function\">exec</span> -it some_container /bin/bash</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"How To SSH Into Docker Container","date":"June 06, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2017/06/06/how-to-ssh-into-docker-container/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017/06/03/see-how-many-files-are-in-each-directory-for-a-give-directory"},"frontmatter":{"title":"See how many files are in each directory for a give directory"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017/06/07/see-how-many-files-are-in-each-directory-for-a-give-directory"},"frontmatter":{"title":"See how many files are in each directory for a give directory"}}}}
