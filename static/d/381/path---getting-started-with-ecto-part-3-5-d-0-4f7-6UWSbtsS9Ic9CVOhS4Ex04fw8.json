In the <a href=\"/getting-started-with-ecto-part-2/\">last post</a>, we covered how to create migrations, schemas, and changesets. In this post we will cover how to create records in our database.</p>\n<h2>Ecto is not an ORM</h2>\n<p>If you come from Ruby on Rails or .Net then you might be familiar with Active Record or Entity framework. You might be used to doing something like <code class=\"language-text\">user.Save()</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">User.Find()</code>. These and many frameworks follow the Active Record design pattern which is an approach of accessing data in a database. One of the major drawbacks of this pattern is that your domain is usually tightly coupled to a certains persistence layer.</p>\n<p>Ecto follows the Repository design pattern which is an abstraction of the data layer and a way of centralising the handling of the domain objects. In Ecto, queries are done using the <code class=\"language-text\">Ecto.Query</code> DSL agains our repository (<code class=\"language-text\">GettingStartedWithEcto.Repo</code>).</p>\n<p>Okay, let’s move on to creating records.</p>\n<h2>Creating Records</h2>\n<p>The first thing we are going to create a user with credentials. Check out the database design in part 2 for reference.</p>\n<h3>Adding Relationships</h3>\n<h2>Updating Records</h2>\n<h2>Deleting Records</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting Started with Ecto Part 3: Creating Records","date":"December 03, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/getting-started-with-ecto-part-3/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/getting-started-with-ecto-part-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Getting Started with Ecto Part 2: Migrations, Schemas, and Changeset"}},"next":null}}
