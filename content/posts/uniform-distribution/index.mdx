Uniform distribution is a statistical concept that describes a situation where all outcomes are equally likely. Simply put, this means that each possible outcome has the same chance of occurring. The uniform distribution is often represented as a flat line on a graph, as all outcomes have the same height.

Imagine you have a fair die with six sides. When you roll the die, each number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) has an equal chance of being the result. This is an example of a uniform distribution.

Another example of a uniform distribution is when you randomly select a person from a group of people. If the group is large enough and everyone has an equal chance of being selected, the distribution of the selected individuals will be uniform.

Uniform distributions are commonly used in statistical analysis and can be found in many real-world situations. For example, in a study of customer wait times at a restaurant, the wait times could be uniformly distributed between the minimum and maximum wait times.

In conclusion, uniform distribution is a concept that states that all outcomes are equally likely to occur. Understanding this concept is important for statistical analysis and real-world applications.
