## Problem

When moving my blog from Ghost to Gatsby, I ran into a small issue. I wanted to have custom links instead of the default directory name inside of pages, something like `/2018-01-12/path-to-a-page` instead of `/path-to-a-page`. I did research, but I didn't find a solution that would support both types of links.

## Solution

My solution was simple and not hard to implement. We are going to support adding `path` option to the frontmatter, that is the content between the three hyphens.

Something like this:

```
---
title: 'Custom URLs in Gatsby Blog Posts'
date: '2018-09-21'
slug: '/custom/path/to/blog-post'
---
```

We also want to support the default way of generating paths which are directory based.

The first thing we are going to do is update our `onCreateNode` in the `gatsby-node.js` to support the `path` field in our frontmatter.

```javascript
let path
if (node.frontmatter.path) {
  path = node.frontmatter.path
} else {
  path = createFilePath({ node, getNode })
}
```

We first check if the node has the `path` field and set the path if it is.
We use the default way of creating the path via the `createFilePath` function as a fallback.

Here's the full `onCreateNode` function inside `gatsby-node.js`:

```javascript
exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, actions, getNode }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = actions

  if (node.internal.type === `MarkdownRemark`) {
    let path
    if (node.frontmatter.path) {
      path = node.frontmatter.path
    } else {
      path = createFilePath({ node, getNode })
    }

    createNodeField({
      name: `slug`,
      node,
      value: path,
    })
  }
}
```

That's all you have to do to support custom URLs in Gatsby. Check out my [blog repo](https://github.com/edgar971/personal-blog/) to see my setup.
