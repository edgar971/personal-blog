I've been using dev containers for about 6 months now in my day-to-day work and I've found them to be a great way to improve my workflow. In this post, I'll discuss how I use dev containers, what's worked well, and what hasn't.

## What are dev containers?

Let's start by defining what dev containers are. 

They are a way of creating a consistent development environment for software development. They are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that can be run on a developer's local machine or in the cloud (more on this later). A dev container basically aims to solve the problem of "it works on my machine" by providing a consistent development environment.

Better yet, dev containers can be defined using configuration files, and they can be shared and reused across different projects or teams. They can also be version-controlled, which allows for easy tracking of changes and ensures that all developers are using the same version of the development environment.


## What about machine learning or data science?

Dev containers are not just for software development. They can be used for any type of development, including machine learning and data science. 

The biggest advantage of using dev containers for machine learning and data science is that they allow you to easily run your code on a GPU or high-end hardware on the cloud. This is especially useful if you're working on a model or project that requires a lot of compute power. This is called a remote dev container and it's all integrated into VS Code. 

## My personal experience

My overall experience of using dev containers has been positive so far, especially for machine learning projects that require a consistent and reproducible development environment. 

1. **Consistency**: Dev containers provide a consistent development environment that can be easily replicated and shared across multiple team members. This helps to ensure that everyone is using the same libraries, dependencies, and configuration settings, reducing the risk of compatibility issues and making it easier to collaborate.

2. **Isolation**: Dev containers provide an isolated environment for development, which helps to prevent conflicts between different software versions and dependencies. This can help to avoid issues that can arise when working with different machine learning frameworks or libraries. Especially with Python, where there are many different versions of the same library, and different versions of the same library can be incompatible with each other.

3. Portability: Dev containers are highly portable and can be easily moved between different machines or cloud instances. This makes it easy to move projects between your laptop and the cloud to access powerful hardware.

There is however, a learning curve. Using dev containers requires some initial setup and configuration, which can result in some slow down and overall headaches, especially if you are new to Docker or VS Code.

There's also the added complexity of having to manage multiple containers, which can be a bit of a pain if you're working on multiple projects at the same time. 

## How can you start using dev containers?

If you're interested in using dev containers, I recommend starting with the [official documentation](https://containers.dev/). It's a great resource that provides a lot of useful information and examples. 

Start with a simple project and try to get it working with a dev container. Once you have that working, you can start to add your own customizations and configurations. 

## What's next?

Github Codespaces! It's relatively new feature that allows you to create cloud-based development environments for your code repositories. They provide a fully configured, browser or local VS Code development environment that can be accessed from anywhere.
